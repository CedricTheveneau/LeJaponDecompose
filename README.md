## Purpose

Le Japon Décomposé is a personal project I created because of my passion for japanese pop culture, which then led me to get interested into the rich culture of this nation as a whole.
The main goal is to to have a place to store all the knowledge I find about this country's culture and language, and share it with others.
Another goal of this project is to show my love for learning (especially new languages !) and keep playing with the new developer skills I aquire thanks to the lessons I follow.

It'll contain many pages, because of all the various aspects of japanese culture I want to abord.
But even with many pages, I still want it to be as easy to navigate as possible and cleaned up.

The header will contain a centered logo, a sandwich menu on the left and a search bar on the right -masked by a search button on smaller screens-.
the main container will consist of a table of content to easily go across all the sections we have. Then you'll find a list of the most recent articles. They'll be displayed as cards with a piture, a title and a catchphrase. and if you click one you'll be redirected to the full article.
Finally, on the right of the page, a list of useful tools (mainly recommended books) that may help you get to a more advanced level at Japanese, everything will have a clickable link that will redirect you to a place to buy/download them.
The Footer will contain contact links, useful links to my main sources of information and legal notices.
**please note that:**

- I'm not a japanese teacher and won't pretend to be, I'm just learning it and thought it might be a good idea to share my experience and what I find with others.
- I won't sell anything on this website, it's more about informative stuff than real lessons, even though I'll try to get deep into the subjects. All products you'll find for sale on this website will be articles recommended to you. I'm not affiliated with any store/brand that could be showed on this website.

To make it simple: **it'll be a great place to learn about japanese culture and the basis of Japanese language.**

## Technologies

- **Bootstrap4** _for a quick and easy setup._

**Please note that:**
**I may need to use JS in the future to implement some functionalities**,_but for now, we're focusing on the V1.0 of the project so we'll see that later !_
